 * Given 2 lists a and b. Each element is a pair of integers where the first integer represents the unique id and the second integer represents a value.
 * Your task is to find an element from a and an element form b such that the sum of their values is less or equal to target and as close to target as possible.
 * Return a list of ids of selected elements. If no pair is possible, return an empty list.
